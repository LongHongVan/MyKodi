    <desc lang="en">Richard Hammond presents this chilly version of Total Wipeout, which sees the contestants wrapping up warm to tackle a snow-covered course with winter-themed obstacles and seasonal challenges. They must manoeuvre themselves past Granny's House, watching out for the angry dog nipping at their ankles and a front door guaranteed to smack them in the face. They then cling onto the ski lift to avoid plunging into the icy waters, before riding the conveyor belt that throws them onto those old Wipeout favourites, the big red balls. Amanda Byram laughs it up at the side of the course.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Sweet Dreams</title>
    <desc lang="en">Sweet Dreams stars Jessica Lange as country-western singer Patsy Cline, whose tragic death in 1963 cut short one of the most fabulous success stories in the annals of popular music. Robert Getchell's screenplay goes the usual route of contrasting Cline's rise to fame in the years between 1956 and 1963 with her turbulent private life. As the wife of hard-drinking Charlie Dick (Ed Harris),Cline is subjected to all manner of abuse and humiliation, yet she stays with Charlie long beyond normal human endurance. A happy second marriage is all too short-lived--as is Cline herself. While the Cline-Dick relationship is presented relatively realistically, the film makes a number of chronological errors concerning Cline's "public" life. Also: how can anyone know what was being said in the last horrifying seconds before Cline's fatal plane crash? Unlike its role model Coal Miner's Daughter (in which Beverly D'Angelo played Cline), Sweet Dreams does not feature the voice of its star during the musical scenes; instead, actual recordings of Patsy Cline, electronically enhanced to match modern technology, are heard on the soundtrack. Song highlights include "Crazy," "I Fall to Pieces," and the title tune(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Resident Evil</title>
    <desc lang="en">The director of Mortal Kombat (1995) adapts another popular video game for the big screen with this gory action thriller. Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez star as Alice and Rain, two members of a commando team assigned to infiltrate the Hive, an underground research laboratory owned by the faceless conglomerate known as the Umbrella Corporation. A bio-engineered virus has been released into the maze-like Hive, turning the facility's employees into mindless, flesh-eating zombies. A single scratch or bite from one of these rampaging ghouls dooms its victim, so the commandos have their work cut out for them as they attempt to reach the Red Queen, the lab's supercomputer -- and their sole hope of halting the spread of the contagion. Before they can complete their mission, however, the soldiers must overcome a variety of deadly obstacles, including mutant dogs, lasers, and a genetically altered beast known as The Licker, whose strength increases with every victim it slays. Alice and Rain also discover that the release of the virus may not have been an accident, and that a cure may exist somewhere in the deadly Hive. Resident Evil co-stars Eric Mabius, James Purefoy, Martin Crewes, and Colin Salmon(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Resident Evil</title>
    <desc lang="en">The director of Mortal Kombat (1995) adapts another popular video game for the big screen with this gory action thriller. Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez star as Alice and Rain, two members of a commando team assigned to infiltrate the Hive, an underground research laboratory owned by the faceless conglomerate known as the Umbrella Corporation. A bio-engineered virus has been released into the maze-like Hive, turning the facility's employees into mindless, flesh-eating zombies. A single scratch or bite from one of these rampaging ghouls dooms its victim, so the commandos have their work cut out for them as they attempt to reach the Red Queen, the lab's supercomputer -- and their sole hope of halting the spread of the contagion. Before they can complete their mission, however, the soldiers must overcome a variety of deadly obstacles, including mutant dogs, lasers, and a genetically altered beast known as The Licker, whose strength increases with every victim it slays. Alice and Rain also discover that the release of the virus may not have been an accident, and that a cure may exist somewhere in the deadly Hive. Resident Evil co-stars Eric Mabius, James Purefoy, Martin Crewes, and Colin Salmon(n)</desc>

The police kept the jealous boyfriend under surveillance until they had the sibling's confession as accomplice. Surprisingly, at trial, Capano himself admitted to removing the body. But, he held onto the claim that Fahey was killed by someone else. Capano was convicted and sentenced to death(n)</desc>

With Jeremy Clarkson in a McLaren MP4-12C, Richard Hammond driving a Ferrari 458 and James May behind the wheel of an Audi R8 V10, the trio encounter mountain passes, empty towns and an abandoned airport before creating their own street circuit in a deserted Madrid development.

    <desc lang="en">Child's Play seems to have been concocted by a parent who went berserk after standing in line for hours on end to purchase a Cabbage Patch doll in the early 1980s. The film opens with serial killer Brad Dourif taking refuge in a doll factory. Dourif is killed by the cops, but not before he has invoked a voodoo curse which transfers his soul into one of the dolls. That particular doll, nicknamed Chuckie, is unwittingly purchased by Catherine Hicks for her son Alex Vincent. Several murders occur shortly thereafter; all evidence points to Alex, who insists that his cherub-faced doll is responsible. Detective Chris Sarandon, the man responsible for Dourif's death, doesn't swallow Alex's story, but he agrees to investigate because he's sweet on Alex's mom. The slasher-flick ending of Child's Play would seem to have settled Chuckie's hash for good and all, but guess again--the film spawned numerous sequels(n)</desc>

Though she struggles with every ounce of her willpower to resist the pleasures of the flesh, Dawn finds her noble efforts to remain chaste repeatedly challenged by her disturbed stepbrother, Brad -- whose provocative advances are becoming increasingly difficult to resist.

Dr Guy Luthan (Grant) is working through another hard shift in the emergency room when he treats a delusional, homeless patient who exhibits wildly erratic and unfamiliar symptoms. To add to the mystery, the man is naked, except for a medical bracelet on his wrist that can only have come from another hospital. Luthan is unable to save the patient, but neither can he forget the unusual circumstances surrounding the man's arrival. He resolves to look into the case further, but when he looks for the autopsy report he finds that it is missing - and so is the body. Unwilling to let the matter drop, despite strong urging from his superiors at the hospital, Luthan continues to search for answers. As this search progresses, he experiences more bad 'luck': his apartment is broken into and he is loses his job. Clearly somebody wants him to stop his investigation. Undeterred, Luthan pursues the truth, and the trail leads to internationally renowned neurologist Dr. Lawrence Myrick (Gene Hackman), acclaimed for his research into regenerating spinal tissue. Myrick's research has the potential to change the world for countless victims of spinal injury - but does this excuse the terrible price being paid by innocent victims?(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Treehouse of Horror II</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Treehouse of Horror II. In the second annual Halloween spookfest from The Simpsons, Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) and Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith) pig out on candy after trick-or-treating, against the advice of their mother Marge (voice of Julie Kavner). Soon the two kids are having nightmares, as is their father Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta), never one to stay away from sweets. In Lisa's Nightmare, a parody of the classic tale The Monkey's Paw by W. W. Jacobs, the Simpsons are vacationing in Morocco when Homer buys a monkey's paw that he is told can make wishes come true. The Simpsons, however, don't use it very responsibly (no great surprise there), leading to misery, disappointment, and an alien takeover. Bart's Nightmare is a take-off on the Twilight Zone episode "It's A Good Life," in which Bart is a monster-child who can make his every wish come true, which makes him hell to be around, especially for Homer after Bart transforms him into a Jack-in-the-Box. And in Homer's Nightmare, Homer is fired by C. Montgomery Burns (voice of Harry Shearer), but that's not the half of his problems -- Mr. Burns and his sidekick Smithers (voice of Shearer) then steal Homer's brain to use in a robot they imagine will be the perfect worker. Appropriately enough, "Treehouse of Horror II" first aired on October 31, 1991(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The remaining six bakers have passed the halfway point of the contest, and now face three European bakes - beginning with yeast-leavened cakes, a tricky cross between cake and bread. Mary Berry then sets them the challenge of rustling up a Swedish princess torte, but they have their work cut out completing all 24 stages of the recipe in little more than two hours. They finish by creating their own version of the dobos torte, a multi-layered cake from Hungary. However, they must go one step further and bake a two-tiered version with an emphasis on caramel. Which of the bakers will come to a sticky end?.(n)</desc>

For the technical challenge, they must prepare a cake that hails from the Brittany region of France - the kouign amann, which none of the bakers has ever heard of - before creating two different types of eclair in the showstopper round.  Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood judge the hopefuls' efforts before deciding who is star baker and who is going home.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Advanced Dough.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The nation's favourite baking contest has certainly proved it can hold its own after moving to BBC One - this series has been the most entertaining (not to mention contentious) yet. It's about to get a whole lot hotter in the kitchen, though, as it reaches the quarter-final stage, and just five amateur bakers remain. They've all impressed to various extents during Bread Week - at least sufficiently to make it through - but now their skills are thoroughly tested as they take on enriched doughs. They have a signature bake in which they must work with soft dough to create artful works, a technical that sees them recreate an Eastern European cross between bread and pastry, and a showstopper involving doughnuts.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc present as the remaining four bakers take a deep breath and head into the semi-final of the nation's favourite baking contest. However, there's no time to marvel at how far they've come - it's Patisserie Week, and they will need to demonstrate that they have skills worthy enough to see them through to this year's final. The bakers are challenged to make a signature baklava - two types of any flavour they like, before the technical challenge demands they knock up a German Schichttorte, a cake cooked in stages under the grill to create 20 layers of different coloured sponge.

But now, just three contestants remain - and only one more weekend of baking stands between them and the trophy. Judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry have saved their most fiendish tests till last, as the finalists face a Signature Challenge in which they have just three hours to prove they have mastered a pastry technique that usually takes a whole day.

    <title lang="en">Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</title>
    <desc lang="en">Terry Gilliam (Brazil, Twelve Monkeys, The Fisher King) directed this colorful, stylized, pseudo-psychedelic $21-million adaptation of the 1971 Hunter S. Thompson classic, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey into the Heart of the American Dream, about stoned sportswriter Raoul Duke, Thompson's alter ego, on a wild drug-crazed road trip, a paranoid plummet into the belly of the beast, with his pal, lawyer Oscar Zeta Acosta. Originally serialized in Rolling Stone (November 1971), the book catapulted Thompson headfirst toward the Kerouac-Mailer-Capote pantheon and jump-started the entire movement of "gonzo journalism." Carrying a suitcase of drugs, Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp with shaved pate) and his attorney Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro) drive a red convertible across the Mojave from L.A. to Vegas, where Duke has an assignment to cover the Mint 400 desert motorcycle race. As the drugs kick in, Duke ventures into voiceover, filling in the blank spots and narrative gaps. "This is not a good town for psychedelic drugs," says Duke, but even so, they consume vast quantities, eventually escalating to ether. Duke notes that with ether "you can actually watch yourself behaving this terrible way, but you can't control it." The two trash their hotel room, and Gonzo goes back to L.A. Thinking the hotel room holocaust will lead to an arrest, Duke begins a drive back to L.A., but after an odd encounter with a highway patrolman (Gary Busey) and a telephone conversation with Gonzo, he returns to Vegas to cover the District Attorney Convention on Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs in the glitzy Flamingo Hotel. This time the drugged-out duo trash their Flamingo room. The crazed carnival atmosphere segues into a carney casino, Bazooko's Circus, where a barker (Penn Jillette) spiels amid aerialists, clowns, and a rotating carousel bar. Gonzo worries over runaway teen Lucy (Christina Ricci), who paints portraits of Barbra Streisand. Soon the hallucinations begin: Duke sees Gonzo transmogrify into a demon with breasts on its back, and an acid vision of a Vegas bar features large legit lounge lizards (courtesy of monster makeup man Rob Bottin). Flashbacks depicting Duke's intro to the drug scene jump back to love-Haight relationships in San Francisco's Summer of Love. Cameos and guest stars include Mark Harmon, Cameron Diaz, Flea, Lyle Lovett, Harry Dean Stanton, Ellen Barkin, Tobey Maguire, and Hunter S. Thompson himself. The film features a Geffen Records soundtrack mixing rock of the period with Vegas lounge tunes. Over the years, various script adaptations came and went as did numerous talents; people connected with past efforts to film Thompson's book include Martin Scorsese, Jack Nicholson, Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi, and writer-director Alex Cox. Shown in competition at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">With Poltergeist, directed by Tobe Hopper, Steven Spielberg had his first great success as a producer. Released around the same time as Spielberg's E.T., the film presents the dark side of Spielberg's California suburban track homes. The film centers on the Freeling family, a typical middle class family living in the peaceful Cuesta Verde Estates. The father, Steve (Craig T. Nelson), has fallen asleep in front of the television, and the dog saunters around the house revealing the other family members -- Steve's wife Diane (JoBeth Williams), sixteen-year-old daughter Dana (Dominique Dunne), eight-year-old son Robbie (Oliver Robins), and five-year-old Carol Ann (Heather O'Rourke). Soon strange things begin to happen around the house; the pet canary dies, mysterious storms occur, and Carol Ann is summoned to the TV set, where a strange shaft of green light hits her and causes the room to shake ("They're he-e-ere!"). As curious events continue, Carol Ann is repeatedly drawn to the television, where she begins to talk to "the TV people." Soon Carol Ann is sucked into a closet, disappearing from this reality plane. Unable to find his daughter, Steve consults Dr. Lesh (Beatrice Straight), a para-psychologist from a nearby college. Lesh finds that paranormal phenomena is so strong in the Freelong household she is unable to deal with it and sends for clairvoyant and professional exorcist Tangina (Zelda Rubinstein) to examine the house in hopes of finding Carol Ann. Tangina makes a horrifying discovery: Carol Ann is alive and in the house, but is being held on another spectral plane(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Poltergeist</title>
    <desc lang="en">With Poltergeist, directed by Tobe Hopper, Steven Spielberg had his first great success as a producer. Released around the same time as Spielberg's E.T., the film presents the dark side of Spielberg's California suburban track homes. The film centers on the Freeling family, a typical middle class family living in the peaceful Cuesta Verde Estates. The father, Steve (Craig T. Nelson), has fallen asleep in front of the television, and the dog saunters around the house revealing the other family members -- Steve's wife Diane (JoBeth Williams), sixteen-year-old daughter Dana (Dominique Dunne), eight-year-old son Robbie (Oliver Robins), and five-year-old Carol Ann (Heather O'Rourke). Soon strange things begin to happen around the house; the pet canary dies, mysterious storms occur, and Carol Ann is summoned to the TV set, where a strange shaft of green light hits her and causes the room to shake ("They're he-e-ere!"). As curious events continue, Carol Ann is repeatedly drawn to the television, where she begins to talk to "the TV people." Soon Carol Ann is sucked into a closet, disappearing from this reality plane. Unable to find his daughter, Steve consults Dr. Lesh (Beatrice Straight), a para-psychologist from a nearby college. Lesh finds that paranormal phenomena is so strong in the Freelong household she is unable to deal with it and sends for clairvoyant and professional exorcist Tangina (Zelda Rubinstein) to examine the house in hopes of finding Carol Ann. Tangina makes a horrifying discovery: Carol Ann is alive and in the house, but is being held on another spectral plane(n)</desc>

Once an ambitious D.A., Clayton is now a shell of his former dynamic self, thanks to a divorce, an unfortunate business venture, and astronomical debt.

Meanwhile, litigator Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton) finds her entire company's future hinging on the outcome of a multi-billion-dollar settlement overseen by Clayton's friend, star lawyer Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson). When Edens snaps and decides to blow the whistle on the questionable case, sabotaging the defense, Clayton must decide between his loyalty and his conscience(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Jackpot</title>
    <desc lang="en">Set 100 miles south of the setting of the Polish brothers' first feature, Twin Falls Idaho, Jackpot tells the story of Sunny Holiday Jon Gries, a down-on-his-luck karaoke dweller who has hopes of becoming a country singer. He has abandoned his feisty wife Bobbi (Daryl Hannah) and young daughter to set off on a nine-month road odyssey with his manager Lester Irving (Garrett Morris), in an effort to collect cash at local karaoke gigs. Lester grooms Sunny by choosing what songs he will do, keeping up with what the judges are like, and negotiating with competitors like Sammy Bones (Mac Davis), another traveling hopeful. On his road journey, he encounters several women, including Janice (Peggy Lipton), a club waitress, and Cheryl (Crystal Bernard), whom he takes home after she has an accident in a restroom, only to find himself being enticed by her underage daughter Tangerine (Camellia Clouse). The road trip comes to a stop, however, when Sunny is pulled over by police who claim that his vehicle is stolen and that Bobbi has reported it. Sunny then seeks refuge with brother Tracy (Anthony Edwards) while he decides his next move. Jackpot is the first released film to be shot with the 24P HDTV camera, which was then blown up to Cinemascope 35 mm format(n)</desc>

The setting is Los Angeles, CA, and the event is the wedding between a man and a woman who always seemed destined to be together. Unfortunately, all relationships can't be as healthy as Elise and Michael's is, and though best man and maid of honor Rich (Aaron Stanford) and Samantha (Melissa Sagemiller) seem to be preparing to take the plunge, the same certainly cannot be said for neurotic actress Lana (Mena Suvari). A free-spirited soul who has experienced flings with a variety of wedding attendees including the hapless Pockets (Jon Abrahams), alcoholic actor Simon (James Van Der Beek), and manic children's television program host Donovan (Ethan Embry), Lana attempts to sort out her past flings as lovelorn agent Quentin (Colin Hanks) pines for the bride's sister and the estranged father of the groom attempts to reconnect with his long-lost son(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Eight Legged Freaks</title>
    <desc lang="en">In this throwback monster movie from producer Dean Devlin (Independence Day, Godzilla), David Arquette plays the son of a deceased mine owner, returning home to the economically depressed hamlet of Prosperity, AZ, after a long absence. His arrival coincides with a toxic waste accident in the local water supply, the result of a barrel jostled loose from the back of a passing truck. Unfortunately, said water source abuts the region's least-popular attraction: an exotic spider farm. The farm's owner (Tom Noonan) becomes the first victim when the spiders, already possessed of keen predatory abilities, grow to the size of small automobiles. Laying in wait underground, they begin picking off the town's pet and ostrich population, and soon it's all the local sheriff (Kari Wuhrer) can do to raise the alarm before the siege begins. Eight Legged Freaks was produced under the working title "Arac Attack," but the politically conscious producers, concerned the title sounded too much like "Iraq Attack," went with Arquette's brainstorm as a safer alternative(n)</desc>

In the early 1980s, a hastily assembled army of Afghan "freedom fighters" achieved the remarkable feat of fending off Soviet invaders despite the fact that the odds were overwhelmingly stacked against them. At the time, Texas congressman Charlie Wilson (Hanks) was a key member of the hugely powerful House Appropriations Committee. Illuminated to the specifics of this remarkable war by a high-profile Houston socialite, Wilson spearheaded an effort to provide hundreds of millions of dollars in weapons and training to the Mujahideen with more than a little help from brilliant but prickly CIA operative Gust Avrokotos(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Note</title>
    <desc lang="en">A struggling human interest columnist finds a simple scrap of paper with a profound message may be the key to saving her column from cancellation in this inspirational, made for television drama starring Genie Francis and Ted McGinley. Peyton MacGruder (Francis) is the "Heart Healer" columnist for the local Middleborough Times newspaper. It's Christmas time, and just as the crew of Flight 848 reports a minor electrical problem, Peyton is summoned to her editor's office for a serious discussion about the future of the "Heart Healer" column. According to the results of a recent reader's survey, the "Heart Healer" column was voted the least interesting item that the paper had to offer, and as a result Peyton is about to get the axe. Just as Peyton's editor warns the writer to improve her standing with readers of hit the pavement, word breaks in the newsroom that Flight 848 has crashed, killing everyone aboard. King Danville, Peyton's friend and colleague at the paper, has lost a dear friend in the crash. Pondering whether or not the passengers realized they were going to die while drowning his sorrows at the local sports bar, King wonders aloud whether they had time to say goodbye to their loved ones, half-jokingly suggesting that Peyton work the concept into her failing column. The following day, Peyton is jogging along the beach when she spies smarmy television reporter Truman Harris interrupting a memorial service for the victims, all the while struggling to find an angle that doesn't seem exploitative. That angle arrives in the form of a note that Peyton finds during another walk along the coast. Sealed inside a small plastic bag half filled with cookie crumbs is a note to "T" from "Dad." Peyton is deeply moved by the heartfelt note, and vows to use the "Heart Healer" column as a means for getting the note to its intended recipient. In order to do so, however, Peyton will be forced to contend with her television counterpart Harris, a tactless reporter whose penchant for sensationalizing a story is only matched by his willingness to resort to underhanded tactics in order to take sole credit for all of Peyton's hard work. And while tracking down "T" proves no easy task, Peyton quickly discovers that her latest story truly resonates with readers upon being informed by her publisher that her "Heart Healers" column has gained a loyal following across the country(n)</desc>

She's on the jury for the trial of a drug dealer and murderer who Ronnie has been trying to nail for years, and the threat to her points to jury tampering, so Jake and Kate have to take a dramatic approach to win the case.

    <desc lang="en">Someday Your Prince Will Be in Effect. In the conclusion of a two-part story (originally telecast as a single one hour special), Will (Will Smith) and the Banks family continue shopping at the mall in preparation for a Halloween party. Along the way, Will and Carlton (Alfonso Ribeiro) compete for the attentions of a toothsome lass named Melinda (Paris Vaughn), with Will trying to impress the girl by listing all the "celebrities" he's met in his lifetime (most of whom appear as themselves in a highly fanciful series of flashbacks). Meanwhile, Vivian (Janet Hubert-Whitten) enjoys a brief moment in the spotlight as a mall singer; gadget-happy Philip (James Avery) threatens to buy out an entire electronics store; and Ashley (Tatyana M. Ali) is falsely accused of shoplifting. Things come full circle when Melinda shows up for the party--along with two unexpected "guests."(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Someday Your Prince Will Be in Effect. In the conclusion of a two-part story (originally telecast as a single one hour special), Will (Will Smith) and the Banks family continue shopping at the mall in preparation for a Halloween party. Along the way, Will and Carlton (Alfonso Ribeiro) compete for the attentions of a toothsome lass named Melinda (Paris Vaughn), with Will trying to impress the girl by listing all the "celebrities" he's met in his lifetime (most of whom appear as themselves in a highly fanciful series of flashbacks). Meanwhile, Vivian (Janet Hubert-Whitten) enjoys a brief moment in the spotlight as a mall singer; gadget-happy Philip (James Avery) threatens to buy out an entire electronics store; and Ashley (Tatyana M. Ali) is falsely accused of shoplifting. Things come full circle when Melinda shows up for the party--along with two unexpected "guests."(n)</desc>

Crested black macaques take advantage of an abundance of fruit, and maleo birds use the sun to incubate their eggs on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. On Java, locals climb volcanoes to offer live sacrifices in thanks for the peaks' help in precipitating rain and fertilising plants with ash. The frequent and heavy rains in Borneo have destroyed the soils, created fierce competition for scarce nutrients, and driven evolution to produce some curious creatures. The Rajah Brooke's pitcher encourages tree shrews to relieve themselves to obtain the substances it needs, while the Bornean red leech is capable of swallowing the giant blue earthworm in one gulp.(n)</desc>

After a shaky start under new manager Claude Puel, the Saints appear to have found their feet and improved on their home form from the early stages of the campaign.

    <desc lang="en">Director Robert Luketic and screenwriters Jason Dean Hall and Barry Levy team up to adapt author Joseph Finder's novel centering on a tech-savvy twentysomething who becomes a corporate spy for a scheming businessman. Determined to make the most of his new job at Wyatt Telecom, Adam Cassidy (Liam Hemsworth) is horrified when a felonious mistake earns him the wrath of unforgiving CEO Nicholas Wyatt (Gary Oldman). Typically, Wyatt's first response would be to throw a lawbreaking employee under the bus. But this time he's willing to cut a deal: Should Adam agree to infiltrate Wyatt Telecom's chief rival, the CEO will turn a blind eye to his employee's error. In no time Adam is climbing the corporate ladder straight to the top. No one suspects a thing, and Wyatt is gaining a distinct advantage over the competition. Later, upon realizing that his success is a mere illusion and he's become a simple pawn in a much bigger game, Adam hatches an ingenious plan to get out of his situation before it's too late(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">His 13th birthday fast drawing near, an unsuspecting young boy on the verge of a remarkable transformation remains completely unaware that an ancient prophecy is set to be fulfilled with the rising of the red moon. To most folks, 12-year-old Timmy (Matthew Knight) would seem an average adolescent with a bright future on the horizon. In the tiny town of Huguenot, however, nothing is as it seems. As Timmy's health rapidly begins to take a turn for the worse, his concerned mother, Rachel (Rhona Mitra), does her best to care for the ailing young boy. Though his mother may not have a clue as to what fate is about to befall her frightened child, a group of specially appointed guardians who have been watching over Timmy since birth know the truth about the events that are beginning to unfold. Timmy is a half-blood, and when the red moon is full, the creature who once appeared to be a normal boy will finally gain the power to take control of his family's destiny. But until that fateful night, Timmy's life will be in constant danger by the renegade faction of lycanthropes who are willing to kill in order to maintain their vicious way of life. It won't be long until the red moon rises, but until that prophesied moment, the forces of light and the forces of darkness will clash in the ultimate battle for true supremacy. Jason X director James Isaac takes the helm for a frightening tale of fate and fantasy co-starring Elias Koteas, Jason Behr, and Kim Coates(n)</desc>

Determined to make the most of his new job at Wyatt Telecom, Adam Cassidy (Liam Hemsworth) is horrified when a felonious mistake earns him the wrath of unforgiving CEO Nicholas Wyatt (Gary Oldman). Typically, Wyatt's first response would be to throw a lawbreaking employee under the bus. But this time he's willing to cut a deal: Should Adam agree to infiltrate Wyatt Telecom's chief rival, the CEO will turn a blind eye to his employee's error. In no time Adam is climbing the corporate ladder straight to the top. No one suspects a thing, and Wyatt is gaining a distinct advantage over the competition. Later, upon realizing that his success is a mere illusion and he's become a simple pawn in a much bigger game, Adam hatches an ingenious plan to get out of his situation before it's too late(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">His 13th birthday fast drawing near, an unsuspecting young boy on the verge of a remarkable transformation remains completely unaware that an ancient prophecy is set to be fulfilled with the rising of the red moon. To most folks, 12-year-old Timmy (Matthew Knight) would seem an average adolescent with a bright future on the horizon. In the tiny town of Huguenot, however, nothing is as it seems. As Timmy's health rapidly begins to take a turn for the worse, his concerned mother, Rachel (Rhona Mitra), does her best to care for the ailing young boy. Though his mother may not have a clue as to what fate is about to befall her frightened child, a group of specially appointed guardians who have been watching over Timmy since birth know the truth about the events that are beginning to unfold. Timmy is a half-blood, and when the red moon is full, the creature who once appeared to be a normal boy will finally gain the power to take control of his family's destiny. But until that fateful night, Timmy's life will be in constant danger by the renegade faction of lycanthropes who are willing to kill in order to maintain their vicious way of life. It won't be long until the red moon rises, but until that prophesied moment, the forces of light and the forces of darkness will clash in the ultimate battle for true supremacy. Jason X director James Isaac takes the helm for a frightening tale of fate and fantasy co-starring Elias Koteas, Jason Behr, and Kim Coates(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Day</title>
    <desc lang="en">A small band of friends make an uneasy alliance with a mysterious lone wolf in this blend of horror and adventure. An unnamed catastrophe has turned the Earth into a wasteland, and as packs of feral cannibals wander the countryside, a dwindling number of survivors struggle to stay alive. Rick (Dominic Monaghan), Adam (Shawn Ashmore), Henson (Cory Hardrict), and Shannon (Shannyn Sossamon) have been journeying together for months and are the last living members of a much larger group. Mary (Ashley Bell) is a solitary woman who crossed paths with the survivors and is now traveling with them. She isn't interested in discussing her past or becoming friends, but the others learn she's a powerful ally in a fight. The travelers take shelter in a house, but are soon surrounded by cannibals; they quickly realize just how strong a warrior Mary can be, while also discovering the terrible truth that led her to wander alone. The Day was directed by Douglas Aarniokoski, who has accumulated extensive credits as an assistant director and helming second-unit material on major films(n)</desc>

As the international dispute between the Soviet Union and the U.S. threatens to cast a shadow over the entire world, Ginger (Elle Fanning) seeks solace in the arts as Rosa (Alice Englert) favors such distractions as cigarettes and boys. Meanwhile, as the bond between the two girls is strengthened by their shared disdain for their respective mothers, Ginger's free-spirited father Roland (Alessandro Nivola) encourages his daughter to protest while sparking a twinkle in the eye of smitten Rosa. But for Ginger, the pain of her parents' breakup becomes too much to endure, eventually driving her into the company of a compassionate gay couple (Timothy Spall andOliver Platt) and their good friend Bella (Annette Bening), a poet. As the future of mankind begins to look increasingly grim, Ginger and Rosa both realize that the days of their friendship might be numbered whether the world ends in nuclear annihilation or life continues on as usual(n)</desc>

During "the very early 1980s," friends gather at a popular Manhattan disco club reminiscent of Studio 54, where getting past the velvet ropes and inside was the first step. Edgy ad-exec Jimmy (Mackenzie Astin) can sometimes get his clients in with the help of the club's womanizing assistant manager, his pal Des (Chris Eigeman), who lets them enter via the rear door. Beautiful brunette Charlotte (Kate Beckinsale) and her former college classmate Alice (Chloe Sevigny) move about the club during the 24-minute opening club sequence. Attorney Tom (Robert Sean Leonard) takes an interest in calm, reserved Alice. Both Alice and the opinionated, assertive Charlotte hold day jobs as entry-level editorial associates at a small book publisher. With Holly (Tara Subkoff) as a third roommate, the trio rents a railroad flat in the Manhattan's Yorkville neighborhood. Charlotte throws dinner parties in an effort to solidify a social circle as an alternative to "the ferocious pairing off" around her(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Grab the rope and swing into the magical land of Terabithia, a wonderful escapist woodland world created in the mind of Leslie, a free-spirited girl who befriends an unhappy boy called Jess at her new school. Together they visit this imaginary place, peopled with creatures based on playground friends and foe, and through their experiences learn how to deal with the highs and lows of life in the real world. This stunning, highly acclaimed film is based on Katherine Paterson's much-loved children's classic, adapted for the screen by her son David, for whom the story was written. The makers of the Chronicles of Narnia have transformed the written word into a CGI-filled masterpiece packed with fantastic characters, which deals with adolescent problems in a sympathetic, saccharine free and entertaining way. It's the perfect family film, with stunning performances from its young cast(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Mighty Casey. This episode was based on an earlier Rod Serling TV play, in which a losing baseball team was saved by a 70-year-old pitcher. In the Twilight Zone version of this yarn, the old man was transformed into a muscular robot named Casey (Robert Sorrell), who comes to the rescue of the cellar-dwelling ball club skippered by Mouth McGarry. Winning game after game, Casey ultimately comes acropper when he suddenly develops human emotions -- and an unwillingness to see anyone lose a ball game! When first filmed in mid-1959, "The Mighty Casey" starred Paul Douglas as Mouth McGarry. Unfortunately, Douglas was in the last stages of the devastating illness that would kill him, and the producers were uncomfortable with his appearance on the screen. After Douglas' death, the episode was refilmed with Jack Warden as McGarry, with Alvin Ganzer taking over the directorial reins from Robert Parrish. "The Mighty Casey" finally aired June 17, 1960, as the next-to-last Twilight Zone of the 1959-60 season(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Donald P Borchers' remake of the supernatural horror, based on a short story by Stephen King, and starring David Anders, Kandyse McClure and Daniel Newman. Back in 1963 a dreadful drought hit Nebraska, and it had a devastating effect on one small, isolated town. Out in the parched fields, one of the community's children had a fire-and-brimstone dream in which it was revealed by an entity called He Who Walks Behind the Rows that the blight was due to the erroneous ways of the adults. The solution was simple: everyone over the age of 18 must die; and so the children slaughtered the town's adult population. From that point on, everyone would be ritually sacrificed upon reaching their 19th birthday to appease He Who Walks... Now, 12 years on, Burton and VIcky Stanton have the misfortune of stumbling upon the ill-fated outpost. Will they make it out alive - or are they destined to come to the same gory end as the others?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A simple case of assumed identity snowballs into a romantic mix-up of epic proportions in director Andy Fickman's contemporary teen take on William Shakespeare's +Twelfth Night. Viola Hastings (Amanda Bynes) has good reason for wanting to conceal her identity upon arriving at Illyria Prep School, and with her twin brother, Sebastian (James Kirk), skirting school in an attempt to break into the London music scene, Viola sees her sibling's well-timed absence as the perfect opportunity to assume his identity. When Viola is assigned a shared dorm room with campus cool guy Duke (Channing Tatum), her facade slowly begins to crumble as she begins harboring a deep-rooted crush on her unsuspecting new roommate. The situation begins to take a turn for the worse, however, when Duke reveals his affection toward campus knockout Olivia (Laura Ramsey), who in turn seems increasingly drawn toward the sensitive imposter known as Sebastian. The problem is, the real Sebastian has decided to cut his London trip short, and upon arriving on campus two days earlier than expected, Viola's elaborately executed ruse hits an unexpected hitch that sends the entire situation spiraling into chaos(n)</desc>

The town happens to be famous for two things: It's the home of "the man who shook the hand of Andy Griffith", and also the home of a brutal axe murderer who strikes every five years--and specializes in hacking up tourists. As the locals place bets as to who will be the killer's next victims, guess which family strolls into the scene? (Aw, you guessed.)(n)</desc>

In the tradition of the ill-fated "Oliver" on The Brady Bunch, Shane Sweet joins the regular cast in the role of a 5-year-old kid named Seven. Left on the Bundy doorstep by Peg's cousins Zemus (Bobcat Goldthwait) and Ida Mae (Linda Blair), the obnoxious Seven appeals to no one but Peg (Katey Sagal), whose maternal instincts are somewhat belatedly awakened!(n)</desc>

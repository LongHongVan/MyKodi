    <title lang="en">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire</title>
    <desc lang="en">Although the once-hot game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? had lost its luster as a prime-time ABC offering, the producers felt that there was enough life left in the property to warrant a Monday-through-Friday syndicated version. Taking over from the earlier series' host Regis Philbin was Meredith Vieira of The View. To make certain that the series would not be bankrupted after its first week on the air, the questions posed to contestants were considerably harder than those on the prime-time incarnation. Also, the famous "fastest finger" round was eliminated, taking some of the pressure off the contestants when they struggled to come up with answers.

    <title lang="en">1408</title>
    <desc lang="en">A writer renowned for debunking infamous paranormal events is confronted by a force that he cannot explain upon checking into room 1408 of the notoriously haunted Dolphin Hotel. Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is an author who specializes in horror, but who only believes in what he can see with his eyes and touch with his hands. Having constructed an entire career on his ability to dispel superstitious "haunted house" rumors, Mike is convinced that the afterlife is a manmade construct designed to offer false comfort to the weak minded. Mike's latest project is a book entitled "Ten Nights in Haunted Hotel Rooms," and it seems that in room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel, this skeptical scribe may finally find proof of the supernatural. Implored by the hotel manager (Samuel L. Jackson) not to enter room 1408, Mike defiantly procures the key and prepares to dispel yet another spectral sham. Now, as is the case with many of life's most profound epiphanies, the writer who thought he knew it all is caught entirely off guard at the precise moment he least expected it. Subsequently faced with undeniable proof of an afterlife, Mike may have a best-seller on his hands if he can simply survive until sunrise. Mary McCormack and Jasmine Jessica Anthony co-star in director Mikael Håfström's (Derailed) adaptation of an original short story by horror icon Stephen King(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Perkins' 14</title>
    <desc lang="en">Dark Ride director Craig Singer returns to the helm with this shocking horror film about a delusional psychopath who creates a unified team of 14 maniacal killers. Produced entirely over the Internet, where writers uploaded story details and actors submitted audition tapes, Perkins' 14 was released into theaters as part of the third After Dark Horror Fest. Ronald Perkins was just six years old when his parents were brutally slaughtered right before his eyes. Unable to overcome the incredible trauma of witnessing such a diabolical event, Perkins becomes convinced that the killers who murdered his parents will eventually return to finish the job they started years ago -- and he plans to be fully prepared to fight back when they do. Years later, when Perkins turns 34, he kidnaps 14 people from his hometown of Stone Cove and sets about reprogramming them to become relentless killing machines. Now, if the killers ever do return, they'll have to get through Perkins' 14 in order to reach their intended target. Trouble is, now that Perkins' 14 are ready for battle, they've become increasingly difficult to contain(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Fracture</title>
    <desc lang="en">A structural engineer (Anthony Hopkins) and an ambitious young district attorney (Ryan Gosling) become locked in a deadly battle of wits when the former is found innocent in the attempted murder of his wife in director Gregory Hoblit's tense tale of courtroom mind games. Ted Crawford (Hopkins) is an engineer who lives with his wife, Jennifer (Embeth Davidtz), in the couple's lavish Southern California home. One day, after carefully planning out the details to ensure that there is no way he can be convicted of murder, Ted shoots his wife in a blatant attempt to kill the woman. When head hostage negotiator Rob Nunally (Billy Burke) arrives on the scene to speak with Ted, he is shocked to find that the victim of the shooting is in fact his longtime lover. Though Jennifer survives the trauma of being shot in the head at close range, she hovers comatose between life and death as star prosecutor Willy Beachum (Gosling) reluctantly accepts the case while preparing to leave the Los Angeles criminal court system behind for a more promising career at a posh private law firm. Though the DA (David Strathairn) vehemently resents Beachum's lofty plan for departure, the hotshot young lawyer remains convinced that he can expedite the apparently open-and-shut case and be on his way to greener pastures in one week's time at the very most. Beachum's swelling ego betrays him, however, as his future boss Nikki Gardner (Rosamund Pike) begins to turn up the heat and fracture mechanics specialist Ted chooses to represent himself at the trial knowing well that a career spent spotting structural flaws in aeronautical systems has instilled him with just the kind of argumentative skills needed to riddle the swaggering young lawyer's "foolproof" case with doubt(n)</desc>

In the movie's opening sequence, he's eating at a New York restaurant when the gorgeous Jess approaches his table and asks him to pretend to be her boyfriend so that she can avoid a particularly determined guy at the bar who won't stop hitting on her. The two of them hit it off, but he quickly figures out that she's running a scam on him and soon turns the tables on her and her partner. Undaunted, Jess begs Nicky to teach her what he knows about the criminal life, and he brings her in on a plan to steal from as many people as possible during Super Bowl week in New Orleans. She turns out to be a natural, and quickly learns the ropes of this unscrupulous world. Nicky and Jess seem to be falling for each other, but Nicky's actions at the end of their New Orleans trip force Jess to reassess their relationship. Three years later, Nicky enters into a deal with Garriga (Rodrigo Santoro), a wealthy playboy who has a software program that will help his Formula 1 team triumph. Nicky agrees to help Garriga sell a fake version of the program to his competitors, but as the plan goes into motion he discovers Jess and Garriga are a couple. As old feelings complicate the new arrangement, Nicky must also contend with the no-nonsense Owens (Gerald McRaney), Garriga's head-of-security who openly distrusts Nicky(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Only four bakers remain as the semi-final arrives. This week, the contestants must demonstrate their mastery of patisserie in three more challenges. However, the stakes have never been higher, and a disaster in any one of the rounds might mean the difference between claiming a place in the final, or bowing out early. In the Signature, the bakers must achieve perfect lamination on French pastries, and in the Technical, Paul Hollywood puts the amateurs through their paces with a yeast-based cake with a fruity top and delicate chocolate work. For the Showstopper finale, the competitors face a multiple mini-cake bake, with Paul and fellow judge Mary Berry expecting a high-end finish that demonstrates the bakers' ability to manage their time.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jacques Peretti looks beyond the well-known budgets of schools, hospitals and foreign aid to the range of taxation projects the public know less about. Peretti finds that local councils across the UK are signing contracts with management consultancy firms who can take a percentage of any savings they find. He also reveals that hundreds of the millions of taxpayers' pounds spent on these contracts are covered by confidential deals, meaning very little detail is known about them. In this revealing insight, Peretti asks if the public deserves to know more about how those charged with managing the nation's billions are spending it.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The story of how Barack Obama resolved to reform the healthcare system in the United States, despite stern opposition from the Republicans and within his own party. The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, was finally signed into law in 2010 after years of wrangling, as senior Democrats urged Obama to be less ambitious with his plans and Tea Party protesters gained greater prominence. While the President eventually got the act passed, the consequences have been felt for the rest of his tenure, with the Republicans blocking all future major reforms after securing huge gains in the mid-term elections.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Documentary shedding light on the work of housing officers working in the London borough of Barking and Dagenham, where a shortage of affordable homes, rising rent prices and a lack of available council housing have all contributed to an increase in the number of people facing homelessness. Drawing comparisons to the 1966 television play Cathy Come Home, which depicted a young couple's descent into poverty and homelessness, the programme explains how problems first encountered 50 years ago are resurfacing. Recorded over the course of nine months, the film details how a new generation of would-be residents are looking in vain for a place to call their own.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Paul Nash - The Ghosts of War.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Presenter Andrew Graham-Dixon explores how three British artists - David Bomberg, Walter Sickert and Paul Nash - responded to the cataclysm of the First World War. He begins by focusing on the work of Paul Nash, who sketched the battlefields of Flanders near Ypres on 25th May 1917. He was so fixed on his work that he tripped and fell into a trench, breaking his ribs - an accident that went on to save his life and influence his later work.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Bridget Jones's Diary</title>
    <desc lang="en">Based on Helen Fielding's hugely popular novel, this romantic comedy follows Bridget (Renee Zellweger), a post-feminist, thirty-something British woman who has a penchant for alcoholic binges, smoking, and an inability to control her weight. While trying to keep these things in check and also deal with her job in publishing, she visits her parents for a Christmas party. They try to set her up with Mark (Colin Firth), the visiting son of one of their neighbors. Snubbed by Mark, she instead falls for her boss Daniel (Hugh Grant), a dashing lothario who begins to send her suggestive e-mails that soon lead to a dinner date proposition. Daniel reveals that he and Mark attended college together, during which time Mark had an affair with his fiancée. When Bridget finds Daniel cavorting with an American colleague, she decides to change her life with a new job as a TV presenter. At a dinner party, she bumps into Mark again, who expresses his affection for her; when Daniel claims he wants Bridget back, the two fight over who deserves her affections the most. Popular British performers Gemma Jones, Jim Broadbent, and Shirley Henderson appear in the supporting cast(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Winter Wipeout</title>
    <desc lang="en">Richard Hammond presents this chilly version of Total Wipeout, which sees the contestants wrapping up warm to tackle a snow-covered course with winter-themed obstacles and seasonal challenges. They must manoeuvre themselves past Granny's House, watching out for the angry dog nipping at their ankles and a front door guaranteed to smack them in the face. They then cling onto the ski lift to avoid plunging into the icy waters, before riding the conveyor belt that throws them onto those old Wipeout favourites, the big red balls. Amanda Byram laughs it up at the side of the course.(n)</desc>

Fitness fanatic Tracey kicks off the contest with her European-Asian fusion menu, though one of her guests creates a stir when they claim to have a rather unusual job. Next up is eccentric accountant Jeremy, who lives with his mother and even recruits her to help him with the meal. Regardless, the diners are left feeling neglected after the starter, and a shock is in store during a visit to the host's room. Drama graduate Sarah fails to convince everyone she can pull off a Thai feast, while hairdresser and am-dram fan Simon goes all out on his woodland theme, before the winner is finally revealed.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The trio of motoring enthusiasts embark on another epic road trip, this time across western America in front-engined supercars. Jeremy Clarkson pilots the Lexus LFA, which has a spectacularly high-revving V10 powerplant, Richard Hammond gets behind the wheel of the muscular Dodge Viper, and James May opts for the latest incarnation of Aston Martin's Vanquish. On their journey from Las Vegas to Palm Springs via Los Angeles, the presenters tackle racing circuits and find themselves in a race against the police, before rushing to the Mexican border - and there's a terrifying penalty for the last man to arrive. Meanwhile, Fleetwood Mac drummer Mick Fleetwood rolls up his sleeves to thrash the Reasonably Priced Car.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jonas Armstrong stars in this drama about the fateful last voyage of the 19th-century Nantucket whaling ship Essex, which was attacked and sunk by a sperm whale in 1820, leaving the crew struggling to survive in three smaller boats. Stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, the men must decide whether to head for the nearest islands, 1,000 miles downwind to the west, or set out on an epic journey of almost 3,000 miles to reach the South American mainland. Seen through the eyes of 14-year-old cabin boy Thomas Nickerson, the incident went on to inspire Herman Melville's book, Moby-Dick. Newcomer Charles Furness plays the young Nickerson, with West Wing and Apocalypse Now star Martin Sheen as the older man, while the crew includes Paul Kaye, Adam Rayner and Jolyon Coy.(n)</desc>

Alice looks at evidence of the bear-sized Shasta ground sloth in a cave in the Grand Canyon, and learns about the strange armadillo-like glyptodont - which was the size of a small car.(n)</desc>

Alice looks at evidence of the bear-sized Shasta ground sloth in a cave in the Grand Canyon, and learns about the strange armadillo-like glyptodont - which was the size of a small car.(n)</desc>

Lightning McQueen (voice of Owen Wilson) may be just a rookie, but he's convinced that he can realize his dream of zooming by the checkered flag if he can only make it to California in time to compete in the upcoming Piston Cup Championship. When Lightning takes a detour into the slow-moving, Route 66 town of Radiator Springs, however, it begins to appear as if his shot at the big time has effectively stalled out. Of course, Lightning's exciting cross-country trek wasn't all for naught, and after befriending such quirky Radiator Springs residents as Sally the Porsche (voice of Bonnie Hunt), Doc Hudson (voice of Paul Newman), and Mater the Tow Truck (voice of Larry the Cable Guy), the eager young racer learns that sometimes life is more about the voyage than the outcome of the race(n)</desc>

Goaded by Downey, Woods takes up one last "lost cause:" that of Korean-American prison inmate Yuji Okomoto, who is about to be tried for the self-defense slaying of another prisoner. As Woods investigates, he unearths several iniquities in the trial that sent Okomoto to prison. Despite the fact that the one witness who might clear Okomoto is an unhinged conspiracy theorist, Woods endeavors to re-open Okomoto's case--which plays right into the hands of sharkish, politically ambitious DA Kurtwood Smith. Chock full of plot twists and last-minute shockers, True Believer was popular enough to inspire a spin-off TV series, Eddie Dodd(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Treehouse of Horror III. It's Halloween again, and the Simpson family is having a party, with everyone trying to top each other with tales of terror. In Clown Without Pity, Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) forgets to buy a birthday present for Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright), and finds a talking Krusty the Clown doll at a strange little shop. Homer soon realizes, however, that he didn't get an ordinary toy; the doll threatens to kill him and chases him around the house with a knife when it isn't busy trying to convince the Malibu Stacy doll owned by Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith) that she looks awfully warm in that cheerleader's outfit. Grampa passes along his own version of the classic monster epic King Kong -- King Homer -- in which Mr. Burns and Smithers (both voiced by Harry Shearer) set out to capture the giant ape King Homer, using aspiring starlet Marge Bouvier (voice of Julie Kavner) to lure the beast into their trap. And in Dial "Z" For Zombie, Bart learns the local library is a lot more interesting than he imagined when he finds a book of magic spells that can be used to reanimate the dead. Bart and Lisa use one of the incantations to resurrect their departed cat, Snowball I, but they make a few miscalculations, and soon Springfield is crawling with "the living impaired" who've passed on over the past two centuries. "Treehouse Of Horror III" was first aired on October 29, 1992(n)</desc>

He also begins his campaign to get the public growing their own vegetables by matching up landowners with keen would-be gardeners who do not have access to their own plots. Two teams compete in a foraging challenge by trying to find ingredients from the surrounding area, and the Bristol smallholders take delivery of three milking goats.(n)</desc>

First up they create their signature savoury crackers for cheese, and are encouraged to push the flavour. In the technical challenge, they have to prepare Mary Berry's Florentines, with their chewy caramel sauce and brandy-snap texture, before ending with a showstopper like no other - three-dimensional scenes made entirely from biscuits.

Joel Barish and Clementine Kruczynski were once madly in love, but their affair has gone stale. And when they meet again by chance, she doesn't just blank him, she genuinely doesn't know him. Then Joel finds out the truth. Using a new and highly experimental technology, she is having her memories of him erased from her brain. In revenge, he's determined to undergo the same process but, as dodgy scientist Dr Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) begins the procedure, Joel changes his mind. Can he hang on to enough memories to win Clementine back?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A couple coming to terms with living in a new culture discover their troubles are compounded by their son in this drama from filmmaker Mira Nair. Ashoke (Irfan Khan) and Ashima (Tabu) are a young couple who are brought together in an arranged marriage and soon leave Calcutta to seek their fortune in America. As the couple becomes accustomed to one another, they learn to deal with the coolness and superficiality of life in New York, even as they revel in the opportunities the city offers them. Before long, Ashima gives birth to a baby boy, and pressed to choose a name, they dub the infant Nikhil, though he soon picks up the nickname Gogol, after Ashoke's favorite author. By the time the child is old enough to attend school, he insists upon being called Gogol at all times, and he displays little interest in his Indian heritage. Several years on, Gogol has decided he wants to be called Nick (and is now played by Kal Penn) and has become a thoroughly Americanized teenager, openly rebelling against his parents, smoking marijuana in his room, and dating Maxine (Jacinda Barrett), a preppy blonde from a wealthy family. Ashoke and Ashima are uncertain about how to deal with their son's attempts to cut himself off from their culture, but Nick begins expressing some uncertainty himself when he meets Moushumi (Zuleikha Robinson), a beautiful girl who also comes from a family of Indian expatriates. The Namesake was adapted from the bestselling novel by Jhumpa Lahiri(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Sin City author Frank Miller's sweeping take on the historic Battle of Thermopylae comes to the screen courtesy of Dawn of the Dead director Zack Snyder. Gerard Butler stars as Spartan King Leonidas and Lena Headey plays Queen Gorgo. The massive army of the Persian Empire is sweeping across the globe, crushing every force that dares stand in its path. When a Persian envoy arrives in Sparta offering King Leonidas power over all of Greece if he will only bow to the will of the all powerful Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro), the strong-willed leader assembles a small army comprised of his empire's best fighters and marches off to battle. Though they have virtually no hope of defeating Xerxes' intimidating battalion, Leonidas' men soldier on, intent on letting it be known they will bow to no man but their king. Meanwhile, back in Sparta, the loyal Queen Gorgo attempts to convince both the skeptical council and the devious Theron (Dominic West) to send more troops despite the fact that many view Leonidas' unsanctioned war march as a serious transgression. As Xerxes' fearsome "immortals" draw near, a few noble Greeks vow to assist the Spartans on the battlefield. When King Leonidas and his 300 Spartan warriors fell to the overwhelming Persian army at the Battle of Thermopylae, the fearless actions of the noble fighters inspired all of Greece to stand up against their Persian enemy and wage the battle that would ultimately give birth to the modern concept of democracy(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The critics were falling over themselves to praise this quirky drama that features a stunning performance from newcomer Jason Schwartzman as Max Fischer. Max is his school's brainiest kid by a long way, but he's also the most difficult - and when he falls for one of his teachers, it spells trouble. Bill Murray co-stars as a parent who provides initial solace and then competition for our lovelorn hero. Schwartzman is terrific, but it is Murray who walks off with the movie, along with a plate of carrots(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A couple coming to terms with living in a new culture discover their troubles are compounded by their son in this drama from filmmaker Mira Nair. Ashoke (Irfan Khan) and Ashima (Tabu) are a young couple who are brought together in an arranged marriage and soon leave Calcutta to seek their fortune in America. As the couple becomes accustomed to one another, they learn to deal with the coolness and superficiality of life in New York, even as they revel in the opportunities the city offers them. Before long, Ashima gives birth to a baby boy, and pressed to choose a name, they dub the infant Nikhil, though he soon picks up the nickname Gogol, after Ashoke's favorite author. By the time the child is old enough to attend school, he insists upon being called Gogol at all times, and he displays little interest in his Indian heritage. Several years on, Gogol has decided he wants to be called Nick (and is now played by Kal Penn) and has become a thoroughly Americanized teenager, openly rebelling against his parents, smoking marijuana in his room, and dating Maxine (Jacinda Barrett), a preppy blonde from a wealthy family. Ashoke and Ashima are uncertain about how to deal with their son's attempts to cut himself off from their culture, but Nick begins expressing some uncertainty himself when he meets Moushumi (Zuleikha Robinson), a beautiful girl who also comes from a family of Indian expatriates. The Namesake was adapted from the bestselling novel by Jhumpa Lahiri(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This animated musical, based on E.B. White's children's book classic, is about a courageous spider who helps save the life of an ill-fated pig. Wilbur is a young pig (voice of Henry Gibson) who's owned by New England farmer Homer Zuckerman (voice of Robert Holt). One day he is sold to a neighbor, where he meets a sheep who warns him that his fate lies in the confines of the slaughterhouse. Wilbur is terrified of this news until he meets Charlotte, a charming spider (voice of Debbie Reynolds), who is determined to save Wilbur from this dire destiny. By weaving words into her web, she convinces the farmer that Wilbur is some sort of prodigious animal too important to kill. The music for Charlotte's Web was written by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman, who wrote the scores for countless Disney movies, including Mary Poppins and The Jungle Book(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A handful of kids stranded without their parents is determined to make the most of a bad situation in this comedy. It's Christmas Eve, and Oliver Porter (Lewis Black), the passenger relations manager at a busy airport in the Midwest, is looking forward to spending Christmas in Hawaii with his wife after 15 years in a row working on the busy Yuletide holiday. However, fate conspires against him when a massive snowstorm sweeps in and all flights are canceled. Porter suddenly has to deal with a number of stranded passengers, including six tween-age kids who are each flying unaccompanied from one divorced parent to another -- spoiled little rich girl Grace (Gina Mantegna), geeky but likable Spencer (Dyllan Christopher), his pesky little sister Katy (Dominique Saldana), plus-size comic book fan Beef (Brett Kelly), grumpy tomboy Donna (Quinn Shephard), and bright but mischievous Charlie (Tyler James Williams). With his hands full and determined to make his way to the islands, Porter puts his assistant Zach Van Bourke (Wilmer Valderrama) in charge of the kids. Zach doesn't care for this assignment and the kids don't care for him, and before long they've escaped from the basement conference room where he's stashed them and turned the airport into their playground. Unaccompanied Minors also features Paget Brewster, Rob Corddry and Teri Garr(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Racing Stripes</title>
    <desc lang="en">A horse of a different pattern becomes a spoiler in a high-stakes race in the family-friendly comedy-drama. Nolan Walsh (Bruce Greenwood) is a farmer who once earned his living training racehorses before his wife was killed in an accident while riding, which led him to leave the racing game. Nolan tends to his farm and looks after his daughter Channing (Hayden Panettiere) and a large flock of animals, who speak to one another but not to humans. After a traveling circus passes through town, a zebra pony is left behind; Nolan takes in the animal, intending to return it to the circus, but at Channing's insistence they keep the zebra, naming him Stripes (voiced by Frankie Muniz). Channing loves Stripes, and the zebra is welcomed by the other critters on the farm, including grumpy Shetland pony Tucker (voiced by Dustin Hoffman), slow-moving hound dog Lightning (voiced by Snoop Dogg), a New Jersey-born pelican named Goose (voiced by Joe Pantoliano), skinny-brained rooster Reggie (voiced by Jeff Foxworthy), and deep-thinking goat Franny (voiced by Whoopi Goldberg). Channing discovers that Stripes can outrun nearly any horse around, and Woodzie (M. Emmett Walsh), a local character who has spent years handicapping the ponies, is convinced the zebra would be shoo-in in the Kentucky Open, a prestigious race held at the estate of champion horse breeder Clara Dalrymple (Wendie Malick). Channing believes Stripes can win, but he'll need the help of Nolan, who isn't so sure he's ready to start training again; meanwhile, Stripes gets plenty of advice from the other farm animals about his big step onto the race track. Mandy Moore, David Spade, and Steve Harvey also contribute their voice talents to the picture(n)</desc>

Or at least that's what their clients think has been happening; as it happens, Will and Jake are confidence men who cleverly stage the ghostly attacks and then take payment for making the creatures they fabricated go away. One day, the brothers arrive in a town and offer to help its people drive away evil spirits, unaware that the community is bordered by a genuine enchanted forest, and that young girls in the village have been disappearing at a frightful rate. The Grimm Brothers must now learn how to deal with real magic, with the help of the lovely but fearless Angelika (Lena Headey).

    <sub-title lang="en">The Days Dwindle Down</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The Days Dwindle Down. This classic episode adroitly utilizes footage from the 1949 theatrical film Strange Bargain--with three of that film's stars, Jeffrey Lynn, Martha Scott and Harry Morgan, reprising their roles in the "new" scenes. Released from prison after serving 30 years for the murder of his boss, Sam Wilson (Lynn) returns to his wife Georgia (Scott) and his son Rod (Art Hindle), who is now a police officer. Georgia and Rod prevail upon Jessica (Angela Lansbury) to help clear Sam's name, and to prove that someone else committed the murder. With the assistance of the original investigating detective, a man named Webb (Morgan), Jessica reconstructs the events leading up to Sam's arrest, with black-and-white "flashbacks" lifted from Strange Bargain illustrating how, three decades earlier, Sam had been offered $10,000 to make his boss' suicide look like murder for insurance purposes. One of the supporting roles is played by Debbie Zipp, who would later become a Murder, She Wrote semi-regular as Donna Mayberry, the fiancee of Jessica's nephew Grady Fletcher(n)</desc>

Glenn Manning (Glenn Langan), believes that her brother is still alive, despite his fall off of Boulder Dam at the denouement of the first movie.Her hope is based on reports out of Mexico about a "very big man" attacking truckers and other passersby in a remote part of the country. As it turns out, Manning (played here by Dean Parkin, since Langan turned down the request to star in a sequel) is alive and hiding somewhere in the mountains, bigger than ever and suffering from serious brain damage, with a hideously deformed face that is covered in scar tissue and missing an eye. Every effort at communicating with the giant fails, and as things always transpire in movies of this sort (at least since the silent version of The Lost World), he breaks out of the place where he is being held and goes on a rampage(n)</desc>

Although far from the best of the early Stooges, the 2-reeler benefited from an above-average supporting cast which included Jewish comic Nat Carr, Hal Roach veteran James C. Morton, and, in her first of many appearances with the Stooges, Symona Boniface. A former playwright turned dress extra, the dignified Miss Boniface signed a contract with Columbia in 1935 and would be on the receiving end of many an airborne pie for years to come(n)</desc>

Eventually the family earn a spot of money by taking in a dramatist as their lodger, prompting Micawber to tell his house guest all about his early life - leading to a series of flashbacks that reveal how and why he came to be in such a woeful position. Co-starring Annabelle Apsion as Micawber's long-suffering wife Emma, with Mark Benton, Jamie Foreman and Adrian Hood.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Inside the Green Berets</title>
    <desc lang="en">The troops at the heart of the harrowing special National Geographic: Inside the Green Berets are far from standard issue military men. As the U.S. soldiers assigned to a outpost in southern Afghanistan christened Firebase Cobra, and required to protect Afghani domestics from the brutal minions of the Taliban, these Berets walk a hair-thin line of risk between life and death, between sanctity and martyrdom. Following 9/11, the U.S. Pentagon restricted this region to the general press for reasons of security and safety, but made a brief, 48-hour exception for members of the National Geographic crew. During that precious span of time, the Taliban indeed struck; two American berets were killed, five others wounded, and members of the camera crew were severely injured as well. Inside the Green Berets presents the footage shot during that two day span, and thus creates an intense and uncompromising glimpse at the lives of the soldiers - the day-to-day risks they traverse, and the heroism they wield - in the said region(n)</desc>

As The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air returns for a third season, rap-happy homeboy Will (Will Smith) returns to the lavish LA home of his relatives, the Bankses, after spending the summer in his old South Philly 'hood. Will has brought with him a new hip-hop hairstyle and wardrobe that thrills his cousin Ashley (Tatyana M. Ali) but greatly annoys his uptight Uncle Philip (James Avery). When he clashes with Philip over the use of his new cell phone, Will is turned out of the house, whereupon he tries to move in with his pal Jazz (Jeff Townes)--but things don't turn out as planned, and before long our hapless hero has been collared by The Law(n)</desc>

But help is on the way in the form of Danny's musician brother-in-law Jesse (John Stamos) and his best friend, standup comic Joey (David Coulier). Despite this sudden surfeit of uncles (both real and spiritual), eldest daughter D.J. is unhappy--and to show her discomfort, she moves out of the house and into the family garage.

Now that the theaters and large performance venues have been taken over by rock bands and pop singers, the illusionist has been forced to ply his trade at small gatherings in bars, cafés, and basements in order earn a living. One day, while performing in a small Scottish pub located on a remote island that has only recently been wired for electricity, the illusionist encounters a young girl named Alice, who is captivated by his otherworldly abilities. Alice believes that the downtrodden performer possesses genuine supernatural powers, and agrees to accompany him on a trip to Edinburgh, where he's scheduled to perform at a modest, out-of-the-way theater. Her affection and enthusiasm inspire the illusionist, who in turn uses his talent to lavish her with a series of extravagant gifts. Unable to muster the courage to tell his starry-eyed admirer the truth about his trade, the illusionist continues giving until he's got nothing more to offer. This picture marked Chomet's first following the 2003 arthouse smash The Triplets of Belleville(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Shadow Zone: The Undead Express</title>
    <desc lang="en">A horror semi-parody targeted at the young adult market that ravenously gobbles up horror books like R.L. Stine's Goosebumps series, this made-for-TV vampire tale stars Chauncey Leopardi as Zach, a teenage rebel with a flair for telling ghost stories, who stumbles on an underground cabal of vampires when he takes a fateful ride on a New York subway. The vampire's leader, Valentine (Ron Silver), proposes a deal to young Zach, offering him safe passage to the world above, thus enabling the trapped vampire -- who can only mingle with humanity through the willing assistance of an innocent youth -- to reach the surface as well. Our young hero balks at this idea and escapes to the surface with a wild story for his skeptical pals, who shun him until one of their number is kidnapped by the undead subway dwellers in exchange for Zach's cooperation. Though atmospherically photographed, this low-budget production is a bit too corny to provide either laughs or chills, and it suffers further from lethargic pacing(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Felicia's Journey</title>
    <desc lang="en">Directed by Atom Egoyan, Felicia's Journey is a low-key psychological thriller about the relationship between a lovesick young woman and an older man with an ugly secret. Felicia (Elaine Cassidy) has lived all of her life in a small village in rural Ireland. She has fallen in love with a boy named Johnny (Peter McDonald), so when Johnny unexpectedly travels to England in search of a job, Felicia wants to follow him -- especially since she's pregnant, a fact that she's keeping secret from her family, as well as Johnny. However, Johnny's family refuses to give her his address, so she leaves for Birmingham with only a sketchy idea of his whereabouts. Shortly after arriving, Felicia encounters Joseph Ambrose Hilditch (Bob Hoskins), the meticulous manager of a catering concern. She needs a place to stay and he recommends a good bed-and-breakfast. They soon become friendly, but Hilditch is more than just a mildly eccentric middle-aged man with a taste for French cuisine: he's had a long history of using and abusing homeless women, and Felicia looks like she's doomed to be the next victim. Based on a novel by William Trevor, Felicia's Journey was shown in competition at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">An ambitious young female singer moves to New York City in search of stardom, but finds only disappointment until falling for a struggling record-industry executive who helps her down the road to fame. Songwriting duo Gretta (Keira Knightley) and Dave (Adam Levine) had been dating since college when they decided to seek their fortune in NYC. When Dave is signed by a major label, temptation proves too powerful for him to resist and the couple call it quits. Crestfallen, Gretta fights to get back on her feet until one night, while performing in the East Village, she catches the attention of Dan (Mark Ruffalo), a once-respected music executive who's since fallen on hard times. Enchanted by Gretta's powerful voice and skillful songwriting, Dan convinces her to join him in a collaboration that will transform them both over the course of one unforgettable summer.

    <title lang="en">The Royal Tenenbaums</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Wes Anderson and his longtime friend and writing partner Owen Wilson follow up Bottle Rocket (1996) and Rushmore (1998) with this similarly offbeat comedy about a dysfunctional family reunion. Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) was a successful attorney who had three children with his wife Etheline (Anjelica Huston), an archaeologist. Each of the Tenenbaum kids was a precocious genius: Chas (Ben Stiller) made a killing as a child investor. Richie (Luke Wilson) was a junior tennis champ and three-time U.S. Nationals winner. The adopted Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) was a playwright who won a 50,000-dollar Braverman Grant in the ninth grade. When Royal abruptly left his family, however, it was the beginning of two decades of betrayal and failure that would scar the Tenenbaums for life. Their past resentments are bitterly held against Royal when he suddenly reappears, claiming to have six weeks to live and a desire to reconnect with his family. Typically, Royal's story is a sham, but his presence and sincere desire for absolution soon have a profound effect on the Tenenbaums, who are each dealing with thwarted desires and relationships. Among them are Richie's lifelong love for Margot, who's unhappily married to Raleigh St.Clair (Bill Murray) and Etheline's eccentric engagement to Henry Sherman (Danny Glover), who wishes to marry her. The Royal Tenenbaums also co-stars Owen Wilson and features narration provided by Alec Baldwin(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Royal Tenenbaums</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Wes Anderson and his longtime friend and writing partner Owen Wilson follow up Bottle Rocket (1996) and Rushmore (1998) with this similarly offbeat comedy about a dysfunctional family reunion. Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) was a successful attorney who had three children with his wife Etheline (Anjelica Huston), an archaeologist. Each of the Tenenbaum kids was a precocious genius: Chas (Ben Stiller) made a killing as a child investor. Richie (Luke Wilson) was a junior tennis champ and three-time U.S. Nationals winner. The adopted Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) was a playwright who won a 50,000-dollar Braverman Grant in the ninth grade. When Royal abruptly left his family, however, it was the beginning of two decades of betrayal and failure that would scar the Tenenbaums for life. Their past resentments are bitterly held against Royal when he suddenly reappears, claiming to have six weeks to live and a desire to reconnect with his family. Typically, Royal's story is a sham, but his presence and sincere desire for absolution soon have a profound effect on the Tenenbaums, who are each dealing with thwarted desires and relationships. Among them are Richie's lifelong love for Margot, who's unhappily married to Raleigh St.Clair (Bill Murray) and Etheline's eccentric engagement to Henry Sherman (Danny Glover), who wishes to marry her. The Royal Tenenbaums also co-stars Owen Wilson and features narration provided by Alec Baldwin(n)</desc>

His larger-than-life persona and performances are fuelled by a passion for theatre and storytelling. This candid profile reveals the man and his music through his own testimony and from the accounts of those closest to him. Meat Loaf's life story is one of epic proportions - he survived a childhood of domestic violence only to face years of record company rejection, before eventually finding global fame. Along the way he experienced bankruptcy, health scares, bust-ups and one of the greatest comebacks of all time. All this and more is explored in the film, which features behind-the-scenes footage of his recent Las Vegas residency, plus plans for a new album featuring songs by Jim Steinman(n)</desc>

It's the mid-1970s and Southern Californian teen Joan Larkin has changed her name to Joan Jett. Along with her new dark, edgy identity comes a nascent desire: to create an all-girl rock band. Joan and her aggressive manager Kim Fowley stumble across the perfect face for the band: the 15-year-old blonde bombshell Cherie Curie. The two girls become close, with Cherie's sweet melodies slickly harmonising with Joan's electrifying guitar solos to great effect. They name themselves The Runaways and, after recruiting a lead guitarist and a bass player, are soon signed to Mercury Records, plunging them into the deep end of 70s rock excess. The success of their first album is massive. But, after a concert in Japan, the rest of the band discover magazines that feature only pictures of Cherie inside them - and are furious that they've been left out. Cherie begins to crumble under the pressures of being the face of the band, and starts to find solace in alcohol and drugs.

    <desc lang="en">Alan Paton's classic novel about two fathers coming to terms with personal loss and the emotional scars inflicted on South Africa during the era of apartheid was brought to the screen for a second time with this adaptation, the first major film produced in South Africa after Nelson Mandela's election ended mandatory white rule in that nation. Rev. Stephen Kumalo (James Earl Jones) is a minister from a poverty-stricken farming community who travels to Johannesburg for the first time in search of his son Absalom (Eric Miyeni), who moved to the city some time back and has gone missing. Kumalo regards the big city as a den of iniquity, and his low expectations are not betrayed; he is robbed and beaten shortly after he arrives, and when he visits his brother John (Charles S. Dutton), he discovers that Absalom has become a petty thief with a pregnant girlfriend, his sister Gertrude (Dambisa Kente) is a prostitute, and John has renounced his faith in God and advocates the violent overthrow of South Africa's white leadership. James Jarvis (Richard Harris) -- a wealthy white landowner from the same part of the country as Kumalo -- has also arrived in Johannesburg, also with sad personal business to attend to; his son, a well-liked activist for the rights of the city's black majority population, was killed during a robbery(n)</desc>

Only the intervention of a "ghost" from Jameson's past can prevent him from ruining the life of Kittridge's daughter Suzanna (Dody Heath).

A fearless warrior immune to vampires, Blade (Snipes) has become a hated enemy of the bloodsucking community, and as they gather in their desert compound, a group of vampires is plotting to eliminate Blade once and for all by turning the mortal community against him. The vampires have concocted a misinformation campaign that paints a picture of Blade as a ruthless murderer and has sent the FBI on the vampire hunter's trail, led by the relentless agent Cumberland (James Remar). At the same time, the vampires have brought their founding father, Dracula, back to his undead state, renaming him Drake (Dominic Purcell) and investing him with special powers that allow him to walk unharmed in daylight. After a dangerous encounter with Cumberland, Blade and his ally, Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), form an uneasy alliance with a scruffy team of human vampire slayers, the Nighstalkers, led by Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds), and Whistler's daughter, Abigail (Jessica Biel. While Sommerfield (Natasha Lyonne), a biologist working with the Nightstalkers, researches a scientific answer to the vampire problem, Blade and his comrades take a more hands-on approach against Drake and his minions, including Danica Talos (Parker Posey), Asher (Callum Keith Rennie), and Grimwood (Triple H).
